# FROCKS

This repository contains the code to run and reproduce the experiments for federating the ROCKET algorithm in the following settings:
- Federated baseline
- FROCKS

## Usage
- Clone this repo.
- Download and unzip the UCRArchive Time Series Classification dataset: [UCRArchive](https://www.cs.ucr.edu/%7Eeamonn/time_series_data_2018/), and place it in the same directory of the repository.
- Install the requirements. 
- Each folder of this repository contains specific instructions on how to execute the centralized, federated, and FROCKS experiments.

## Results
The results directory reports the accuracy and F1-score metrics for all the UCR Archive binary classification datasets. This folder contains also the critical difference diagrams, a useful tool for comparing the performance of the naive and FROCKS methods over all the considered datasets.
